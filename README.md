p2p communication over wifi 


Still researching on the best implementation for sending and receiving connections from peers connected to the same rendezvous server that saves the public and private IP addresses of connected peers. The server ensures that both clients exchange their IP addresses to enable them to perform a local TCP socket connection and authenticaite connections ensuring it is the intended client or peer on the same private network.

Further work and research will be done and implemented.
